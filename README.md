# Patient-Records
Enter and manipulate data of patients for doctors.

Softwares :-

1) Eclipse (IDE) Version: 2021-03 (4.19.0)
2) MySQL 8.0 Command line client
3) Apache-Tomcat v9.0 Server

Information :-
1) I used Servlet, Hibernate, Entity liabraries are Used. 
2) I used jsp for showing info and servlet for processing and orm tool (hibernate). Hibernate used for all Database operations(CRUD).
3) Untill now I didn't added the features but I would like toadd logins for the Doctors and can schedule automatic message to the patients for their next scheduled appointment.

How to deploy :-
1) you can simply download all the files or you can use link to do that.
2) use eclipse (best for me) to deploy the project. and import project to eclipse.
3) you can delete the sample-data and sql file or use that sql file to create database.
4) Run project on server using apache-tomcat. (if not running use index.jsp and run that on server)

Test-case :-
1) you can go to add.jsp page or you can simply go from web browser and add patient.
2) you can view that by show patient which you have added. 
3) you can update and delete after that. (I Have added 3 patient details also for performing test)
